<h2> What is the funda about LeaveAGift ?</h2>

<p>LeaveAGift is India's premier social gifting service.  LeaveAGift is the new uber-cool way of gifting the people of your life.  Whether it's an old friend or close family, you can now gift them freely.  It's fast, simple, and really fun to do.  It can even be free. </p>

<p>So why leave a post behind to wish someone a happy birthday, struggling to figure out how your post is "unique", when you can LeaveAGift for them.  </p>
<h2>What's the catch with free gift cards?</h2>
<p>There is none.  You see every day, merchants spend lakhs trying to get good customers to come check out their store.  LeaveAGift believes (and merchants agree) that customers can directly decide how they feel about a merchant, and so, the advertising money is better spent on them.  Quite simply, merchants would rather have consumers in their store who are happy to be there!</p>
