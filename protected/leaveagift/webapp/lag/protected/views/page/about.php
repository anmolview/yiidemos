<p>The <strong>LeaveAGift</strong> story begins with two people, and two different thoughts that came together in one big idea early in 2012. The company is founded by two serial entrepreneurs who have created numerous successful companies in the US, UK and India.</p>
<p>For Co-Founder <strong>Jaideep Singh,</strong> Facebook was a place where he had to be because everyone else was.  Not because he really liked it.  It was a little intrusive, and frankly, not very practical.  He found liking, sharing and friending gimmicky and a little hollow. But as an intellectual with a fervor for human behavior he liked to see new things emerge and how facebook would throw up some surprising phenomenon.  That element of surprise made him happy to stick with Facebook.</p>

<p>For Jaideep, LeaveAGift is all about surprises.  So often we wish 'Happy Birthday' or say 'Congratulations!' or 'thanks' on Facebook or email, when we would rather say it face-to-face with a hug, a kiss or a gift of some kind.  LeaveAGift started with the idea that our emotions are real, even if expressed remotely.  So we should be able to give something real.  Hence the idea of making it real!</p>

<p>For Co-founder <strong>Girish Khera,</strong> the kernel of the LeaveAGift idea dates back to when he first saw the movie Pay It Forward.  Now, as an Indian the movie was a simple incarnation of the Hindu concept of Karma.  But something about the packaging, the juxtaposition against the notion of 'giving back' or just his general 'mad about you' type fascination with Helen Hunt, made the movie stick.</p>
<p>Anyway, fast forward to early 2012 when Girish was knee-deep in the e-commerce space in India (he still runs his own site as a hobby). Excelling at customer satisfaction was a key part of Girish's philosophy and surprising customers with acts of goodwill made evangelists.  As Girish is often heard saying, "one evangelist brings 100 customers." </p>
<p>One day Jaideep, who often advised Girish on his ecommerce endeavor, came across the phenomenon of social gifting.  It struck a cord with Jaideep's facebook-needs-to-be-more-real impression.  For Girish, it was a triple win:  an easy way for people and brands to spread goodwill, a cool way to acquire 'evangelist' customers and a real business model to boot.  Girish's reaction was, "wow, sounds like you get paid to spread happiness." And so ... LeaveAGift was conceived.  The company was founded in Gurgaon in 2012.</p>
<p>The LeaveAGift team is  dedicated (it is Sunday as we write this), enthusiastic (we're all here in the office), and fun (we just took a break for rasta chai).  We aim to bring a real 'kicked' feeling to Indians by surprising them with real gifts with a hope to enhancing the quality of our social  and social media  relationships. </p>
